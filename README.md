<h1>Download the nth Google Image Result</h1>
<h2>A couple notes:</h2>

<p>You can find your <b><a href="http://www.whoishostingthis.com/tools/user-agent/" target="_blank">user agent here</a></b></p>

<p>For your directory path, be sure to use two back-
slashes for each single backslash in the path 
string. For example, "C:\\user..." becomes "C:\\\user..."</p>

<p>This loveliness is written in <b>Python 3.6</b> so #input, 
literal string interpolation, and the urllib module 
will be different for earlier versions of Python.</p>

<h3>// A bit a background (if you're interested)...</h3>
<p>I somehow got it in my head that my second project 
should be to create a program that would download 
the nth image in a Google Images search. I'm totally
new to this proogramming thing and it seemed pretty 
straightforward. Little did I know.</p>

<p>The Wild West of web scraping is a lot crazier than
I imagined. A full day was wasted as I tried to make 
Selenium happen. (Selenium did not happen.) Another
day was devoted to hunting for APIs. Nothing seemed 
to fit.</p>

<p>A thousand thank yous to Charles and rishabhr0y for 
finally getting me on the right track. My code is
mostly based on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20716842/python-download-images-from-google-image-search#answer-28487500" target="_blank">their code here</a>.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" target="_blank">BeautifulSoup</a>, I love you.</p>

<p>Please enjoy, suggest changes, etc.</p>

<p>~ Mariel</p>
